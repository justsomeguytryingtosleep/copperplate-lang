# Copperplate
Copperplate is a esoteric language similar to deadfish.


Copperplate has a way to output things but it has no way to input them! It only has a few commands, only three in total. It is also case-sensitive, and can deal only with integer values when adding or subtracting.
You can have several commands per line, at least in the Python implementation.
Anything that is not a command is not accepted by the interpreter. As you've probably assumed Copperplate was created in less than 15 Minutes, and can't be very useful.


Getting started:
  Install all the Python files.
  Run the main.py file with a Python interpreter.
